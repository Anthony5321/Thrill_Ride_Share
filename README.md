### **_Getting Started_**

##### Our website is user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a search function that allows users to filter their results based on theme park, rides and other search methods. Our team is dedicated to providing the best possible experience for our users and we're always working to improve our website with new features (listed below). Users can add new theme parks and rides and enter and view specific details once created to keep track of their favorite experiences.
